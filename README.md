Spacecraft State and Covariance Interpolation via Unscented Transforms

UT-Krogh Covariance Interpolation
This repo implements a dynamics-free method for interpolating satellite state covariances using the Unscented Transform (UT) and Krogh interpolation.

Features:
Interpolates satellite states and covariances without knowing the underlying dynamics.

Uses UT sigma points and Krogh interpolation over overlapping epochs for accuracy.
