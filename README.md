Spacecraft State and Covariance Interpolation via Unscented Transforms

UT-Krogh Covariance Interpolation:

This repo implements a dynamics-free method for interpolating satellite state covariances using the Unscented Transform (UT) and Krogh interpolation.

Files:
UT_krogh.ipynb: basic file that will take covariances and can give interpolated covariances at any time
UT_krogh_vs_Salvatore_Alfano.ipynb: notebook that compare UT_krogh with other model
